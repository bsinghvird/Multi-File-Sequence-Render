Welcome to Multi File Sequence Render. A maya tool that lets you select multiple files, set frame ranges, load render settings, and then render out the sequences one after the other. 

There are two ways of running this tool

1. Drag "drag_into_maya.py" into your maya 3D viewport. The tool will then launch
2. If you wish to save this tool to your shelf, first select the shelf you want to save the tool to. Then double click the "generate_save_to_maya_file.bat" file. This will create a file called "save_to_maya.py" Open up the maya script editor, and then select File -> Open Script, and then File -> Save Script To Shelf. A window will open asking you to input a name for the shelf item. Enter whatever name you wish, hit ok and a button will be added to whichever shelf you currently have open.
